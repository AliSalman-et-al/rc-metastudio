# Changelog

All notable RC MetaStudio changes will be recorded in this file.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Added accessible names, descriptions, label associations, and clearer help text across dataset navigation, analysis configuration, results, and plot editors.
- Added responsive sizing for the dataset workspace, new-dataset wizard, results view, and dense data-entry dialogs.

### Changed

- Made recent-project menus shorter, unique, and self-cleaning while retaining full-path details.
- Made effect-size tools easier to find and clarified small-study effects terminology.
- Made forest, regression, and SROC plot edits transactional so failed regeneration keeps the editor open and preserves the last successful artifacts.

### Fixed

- Tightened name, diagnostic count, continuous-data, CSV header, and CSV wizard-state validation.
- Preserved diagnostic subgroup covariates and guarded dataset removal actions after model resets.
- Corrected project-path status updates, CSV control behavior, citation-link availability, and plot-editor window titles.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Added deterministic code-health checks for Python and R, including complexity, coupling, typing, and change hotspots.

### Changed

- Separated domain data, workspace editing and persistence, Qt presentation, and R analysis responsibilities. Project identities remain stable when labels change.
- Made R startup explicit and introduced a versioned Python–R analysis contract.
- Unified ordinary startup and packaged automation, with bundled-R configuration applied before GUI imports.
- Moved automation sequencing and evidence assembly to external qualification scripts while keeping production hooks narrow and atomic.
- Limited future release packaging to Windows x64 and Apple silicon macOS.

### Fixed

- Preserved incomplete entered effects and estimate/SE pairs through undo and project saving, and allowed one-arm workspaces to retain their selectable groups.
- Included complete entered-effect CSV rows consistently, including the first row, while preserving raw-data import inclusion rules.
- Parsed recorded macOS Qt scale strings before validating device-pixel ratios.
- Updated macOS qualification to validate the current atomic workflow completion trace instead of deleted monolithic teardown markers.
- Removed the obsolete startup-wizard record from the macOS archive contract after qualification moved to normal project startup.
- Captured the initial macOS packaged workflow logs and initialized its hang trace before provenance assembly.
- Kept macOS packaged evidence assembly on the same bundled-R and Qt runtime contract as the probes it repeats.
- Made normal macOS app-entry evidence record the validated Cocoa process and post-close state.
- Compared locale variants from equivalent edited projects instead of mixing edited and baseline analyses.
- Removed the false save prompt when opening a project from an untouched startup workspace.
- Restored calculated estimates and confidence bounds when opening binary, continuous, and diagnostic projects, without changing saved inclusion choices or entered estimates.
- Kept complete imported studies included when their CSV contains blank calculated-effect columns.
- Fixed packaged startup without developer R settings and isolated package qualification from inherited runtime settings.
- Updated native and release qualification scripts to the current workspace and analysis contracts, and replaced obsolete shell commands with real lifecycle checks.
- Restored the path-based PyInstaller filter that keeps the explicit private R framework as the sole owner of macOS R libraries.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added package-native summary sensitivity and specificity, sampling-based likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios, SROC AUC and normalized partial AUC, prediction intervals and regions, and named diagnostic heterogeneity estimates.
- Added additive Reitsma meta-regression with continuous and categorical moderators, likelihood-ratio tests, explicit factor coding, and separate editable sensitivity and specificity coefficient plots.
- Added deterministic numerical, visual, adapter, and packaged-runtime qualification for the Reitsma workflow and its PNG, PDF, SVG, and TIFF exports.

### Changed

- Replaced the legacy joint diagnostic implementations with the count-based `mada` 0.5.12 Reitsma bivariate model. Sensitivity and specificity remain familiar selections while a joint request is fitted once.
- Reworked result presentation across the application so conclusions, effect estimates, uncertainty, heterogeneity, model details, warnings, and references appear in a researcher-focused order with readable labels and consistent numerical formatting.
- Expanded Publication Bias output with a primary interpretation, usable-study counts, confidence intervals, exact standard-error ranges, method applicability, caveats, and deduplicated references.

### Fixed

- Fixed SROC labels, region legends, marker-size controls, plot-editor behavior, and binary SVG export so the displayed plot and exported files use the same stored geometry.
- Fixed Publication Bias dialog clipping on native Windows, including high-DPI layouts, and prevented adaptive refits from shrinking unrelated dialogs or workspace windows.
- Fixed partial diagnostic result and citation handling so one unavailable output or method does not discard valid estimates, artifacts, warnings, or references.
- Fixed native adaptive-layout evidence capture and package provenance checks used by the Windows release build.

### Removed

- Removed the Bayesian HSROC sampler, exact-binomial joint implementation, legacy joint method identifiers, and their source/runtime packaging exceptions. Existing diagnostic projects continue to load without migration.

RC MetaStudio starts a fresh maintained-product changelog. Historical release history for the original OpenMeta[Analyst] project is not reconstructed here; see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for provenance.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Added a guided Publication Bias and small-study-effects workflow with package-native eligibility checks, readable results, dynamic statistical-paper references, and per-run regeneration.
- Added ordinary, contour-enhanced, Deeks, and trim-and-fill funnel artifacts, with partial plot failures preserved beside successful outputs.
- Added Default (metafor), RevMan, and BMJ-inspired visual styles, plus expanded Edit Plot controls for funnel artifacts.
- Added method-specific Egger, Begg, Harbord, Peters, Pustejovsky–Rodgers, Rücker, and Deeks behavior.

### Changed

- Made Methods and Plots UI ownership and presentation consistent across the Publication Bias workflow.
- Made effect reconstruction authoritative and propagated corrected effects through all dependent analyses and plots.
- Pinned meta, metafor, and runtime packaging inputs across Windows and macOS for reproducible release artifacts.
- Reorganized verification into focused fast, native Qt, R, and packaging lanes so each behavior has one clear owner and local feedback arrives sooner.
- Reused generated Qt build outputs and reduced redundant native scale matrices while retaining representative standard and fractional-scale coverage.
- Replaced migration-era, source-shape, and taxonomy tests with tests of current behavior and failure boundaries.
- Rewrote the maintained documentation around setup, project files, and releases.

### Fixed

- Fixed R Graphics device cleanup so the Publication Bias workflow does not leak an R Graphics window.
- Fixed result rendering and reference selection so statistical output remains readable and references stay current for the selected method.

### Removed

- Removed retired Qt migration tooling, duplicated verification manifests, stale architecture records, and other maintenance-only artifacts that no longer protected product behavior.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Replaced the macOS release ZIPs with signed, notarized, and stapled disk images that are mounted, copied, and smoke-tested before immutable promotion.

### Fixed

- Fixed the continuous-outcome Back-Calculate Table button remaining disabled when the available summary statistics can be completed under either the mean difference or standardized mean difference assumptions.
- Fixed the dichotomous-outcome Back-Calculate Table button remaining disabled while arm totals are available but event or non-event counts are incomplete; supplied totals are now preserved and become read-only after back-calculation.
- Fixed the macOS startup wizard lifecycle so the main workspace remains visible, exposed, and active after creating or opening a project.
- Hardened native macOS packaging and Developer ID qualification by repairing relocated R signatures and exercising the final signed and notarized application before release.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added protected Developer ID signing, Apple notarization, ticket stapling, Gatekeeper verification, and native requalification for the Intel and Apple Silicon macOS packages.
- Added an immutable `macos-trusted` release profile that carries the unsigned Windows package forward unchanged while requiring both macOS packages to pass the complete Apple trust path.

### Changed

- Reordered the main-toolbar analysis actions to match the Analysis menu and removed non-analysis editing and application actions from the toolbar.
- Restricted stable promotion to macOS-trusted release candidates while retaining explicitly unsigned community builds as prereleases.

### Fixed

- Normalized spaced and dotted `TX Mean` spellings before continuous analyses reach the RCMetaR measure dispatcher.
- Strengthened downloaded release-candidate qualification on Windows and macOS with explicit sample projects, frozen runtime inputs, bounded native smoke execution, and retained diagnostics.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added native unsigned macOS packages for Intel x64 and Apple Silicon ARM64, each built and qualified on matching GitHub-hosted hardware.
- Added one immutable three-platform candidate and release-candidate path for Windows x64, macOS Intel x64, and macOS Apple Silicon ARM64.

### Changed

- Simplified CI around one source-verification workflow, one manual package matrix, and one no-rebuild candidate promotion path.
- Set the supported macOS deployment floor to macOS 14, matching the official R 4.6.1 Apple Silicon runtime requirement.
- Kept unsigned community artifacts structurally ready for a future protected signing and notarization stage without rebuilding them.

### Fixed

- Fixed native macOS packaging, embedded R/rpy2 relocation, Qt framework collection, signing-order preflight, archive reinspection, and packaged sample-project smoke qualification.
- Fixed Golden compatibility parsing for modern meta-regression tables and made reviewed compatibility exceptions exact-row scoped.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added the first native Qt 6 / PyQt6 release of RC MetaStudio for Windows x64.
- Added a self-contained Windows package with Python 3.11, Qt 6.11, R 4.6.1, RCMetaR 0.2.0, and an API-mode rpy2 bridge.
- Added the versioned ZIP-and-JSON `.rcms` project format with schema validation, atomic saves, and converted sample projects.
- Added selectable inference methods to supported standard meta-analyses.

### Changed

- Replaced the Qt 5 and PyQt5 application runtime with the locked native Qt 6 stack.
- Updated generated forms, resources, layouts, accessibility behavior, and packaged automation for Qt 6.
- Updated the splash screen, application/window icons, packaged executable icon, and README to use the new RC MetaStudio branding.
- Improved meta-regression result displays and statistical output formatting.
- Made the Windows x64 package the sole 0.2.0 downloadable artifact; native Intel and Apple Silicon macOS packages are deferred to 0.2.1.

### Removed

- Removed the PyQt5 compatibility surface and legacy pickle-based project loading from the maintained application.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows packaging so R is staged without elevation and the complete Qt/R application is built and qualified through one local-and-CI command.
- Fixed dark-mode contrast for highlighted effect-size cells and Results-window plot previews.
- Fixed Results-window SVG and raster plots inheriting the dark themed scene background instead of painting an opaque white canvas.
- Fixed dataset-type wizard icons so they use crisp light or dark SVG masters without flattening the Diagnostic icon's detail, and made the Diagnostic choice match the other button geometry.
- Fixed standard meta-analysis Method and Parameters dialogs incorrectly using diagnostic likelihood-ratio wording.
- Fixed encoded Unicode code-point markers appearing in result text.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-15 (Prerelease)

### Added

- Added adaptive, screen-bounded layouts across the main workspace, Results window, dataset editor, setup wizard, analysis configuration, data-entry, and supporting dialogs.
- Added packaged native-layout evidence for Windows x64 and macOS Intel x64, including high-DPI and constrained-screen scenarios.
- Added a self-contained semantic SVG icon system for application actions and statistical concepts.

### Changed

- Improved window placement, size persistence, splitter behavior, overflow handling, and high-DPI scaling across the application.
- Improved keyboard access, focus handling, text visibility, and control sizing in data-entry and analysis workflows.
- Improved Results-window plot fitting and made SVG plots render reliably in Qt across supported platforms.

- Added publication-style bubble plots for meta-regression results.
- Added editable plot controls for supported forest and bubble plots.
- Added Windows x64 and macOS Intel x64 prerelease packages.

### Changed

- Improved plot sizing and live reflow in the Results window.
- Improved plot layout, labels, spacing, scaling, and display precision across supported styles.
- Improved PDF, PNG, SVG, and TIFF export behavior and removed unwanted intermediate files.
- Split diagnostic forest results into separate editable plots for each metric.
- Simplified diagnostic and meta-regression setup so method, parameter, covariate, and plot choices use consistent screens.
- Simplified the README around downloading and using RC MetaStudio; moved maintenance commands into a separate maintainer guide.

### Fixed

- Fixed plot edits that did not apply, did not close as expected, or failed for cumulative, leave-one-out, subgroup, and diagnostic forest plots.
- Fixed missing plot-editing and export actions for supported result types.
- Fixed regenerated plots overlapping later Results-window content.

- Added the maintainer policy that unsolicited public code contributions are not currently accepted while public issue feedback may be accepted.
- Documented release-packaging expectations for third-party component and asset inventory.

### Changed

- Started the maintained RC MetaStudio release history instead of extending the original OpenMeta[Analyst] project release history.
- Adopted GPL-3.0-or-later as the maintained distribution posture where permitted by the original GPL-2.0-or-later grant.
- Defined `.rcms` as the maintained RC MetaStudio project-file identity and RCMetaR as the private bundled R package identity for the rebrand.

### Removed

- Removed README language that presented the maintained product as RC MetaStudio Community or as a community fork.
- Recorded the breaking identity direction away from retired project-file, R-package, and abandoned support-channel names for future phase issues.
