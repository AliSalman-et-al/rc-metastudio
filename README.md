RC MetaStudio is an open-source desktop application for performing and reviewing meta-analyses without writing code.

It supports standard, cumulative, leave-one-out, subgroup, meta-regression, and diagnostic analyses. You can inspect results, create forest and bubble plots, export plots as PDF, PNG, SVG, or TIFF, and save your work in an `.rcms` project.

Diagnostic analyses retain univariate sensitivity, specificity, likelihood-ratio, and diagnostic-odds-ratio methods. Count-based joint sensitivity/specificity analyses use the `mada` 0.5.12 Reitsma bivariate model, with editable and exportable SROC confidence/prediction geometry. Additive continuous and categorical diagnostic meta-regression reports separate sensitivity and specificity coefficient plots.

## Small-study effects analysis

Choose **Publication Bias** after at least two included studies to open the guided small-study effects analysis. “Publication Bias” is the navigation label; the analysis reports associations between study size or precision and observed effects and does not provide a bias-present or bias-absent verdict. RCMetaR computes method-specific eligibility from the included study set and shows the exact reason when a procedure or required input is unavailable. Ordinary and contour-enhanced funnels are presentation artifacts that can be edited and regenerated from the saved run. Diagnostic odds ratios use the separate Deeks effective-sample-size funnel.

The workflow reports the package-native methods supported by `meta` 8.5-0 and the distinct mixed-effects Egger model from `metafor` 5.0-1. Depending on the effect measure and available raw inputs, it can show classical Egger, Harbord, Rücker AS+RE, Peters, Pustejovsky–Rodgers, Begg–Mazumdar, Deeks, trim-and-fill, and exploratory infinite-precision estimates. Each result includes its package/version and call; unavailable procedures retain their precise eligibility reason. Read the [small-study effects glossary](CONTEXT.md) for interpretation boundaries and the [release guide](docs/release.md) for runtime verification requirements.

## Download and install

Download a release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AliSalman-et-al/rc-metastudio/releases). Releases built with the three-platform policy contain:

- Windows x64: `RCMetaStudio-windows-x64.zip`
- Apple silicon Mac: `RCMetaStudio-macos-arm64.dmg`
- Linux x86_64 (qualified on Ubuntu 24.04): `RCMetaStudio-linux-x64.tar.gz`

On Windows, extract the archive and run `RCMetaStudio.exe`.

On macOS, open the disk image, drag RC MetaStudio to Applications, and launch it from Applications. The macOS application is Developer ID signed, notarized, and stapled. Windows and Linux packages are unsigned.

On Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, extract the archive and run
`RCMetaStudio-linux-x64/LaunchRCMetaStudio.sh`. The portable archive includes a
private R runtime. Other Linux distributions are not release-qualified.
